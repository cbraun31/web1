What are the requirements of our system?
What tools and materials do we have to work with?


Looks like the microbit can relaibly detect up, down, left, right. 
Using this, what should the flow of our game look like, and which part should we focus on first?
Let's break our problem down into the things our code will have to do:
    - Detect both players' input
    - store the inputs somewhere so we can track the pattern if needed
    - compare the inputs to see if they match
    - store that result somewhere
    - use that result to determine what to do next; reset the 'streak' or continue it 
    - Somehow get the 2 microbits to talk to each other
