Assessment strategies
assessment in programming
    standardized tests vs authentic assessment/projects
    trends in CS interviews
elements of effective feedback
    timely (within 24 hours)
    acknowledging successful parts
    prompt student to expand/consider specific areas?
    Allow for resubmission to reiterate that the teacher is there because they want the student to succeed
    use course text for citations/paper ideas and content for effective feedback techniques/elements
pen and paper vs IDE coding exercises
real code vs pseudocode pros and cons (any research?)
giving good feedback - autograders?
    paper suggests auto graders are actually pretty beneficial to use!
syllabus on course outline, expectations, grading, classroom routines/procedures, and how 'participation' will be measured/graded    
using experiences in class to reflect and improve teaching
    do metrics for performance match expectations based on your experience with the student? Are grading metrics fair? Are they too easy to skirt, or too punishing to students who are doing well?
