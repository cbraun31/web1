        paper suggests auto graders are actually pretty beneficial to use! sources?

syllabus on course outline, expectations, grading, classroom routines/procedures, and how 'participation' will be measured/graded    
    Late work policy to be as flexible as Dr. Panther's <3. Adjustments needed for middle/high/undergrad levels?
    Effects of stress/anxiety on academic performance. A little bit is necessary!

using experiences in class to reflect and improve teaching
    do metrics for performance match expectations based on your experience with the student? Are grading metrics fair? Are they too easy to skirt, or too punishing to students who are doing well?
motivation
    A brief survey of factors affecting student motivation. In the wise words of John Mulaney, "Doing nothing in infinitely easier than doing something. That anyone would do anything is amazing"
