lesson plan formatter tool
quick formative/behavior notebook/stat tracker/table/etc. tool
programming exercise randomizer
Unit planning plug and play modules tool
2. using different exercises in CodeHS
    scaffolding in CodeHS? Choice boards in codeHS? Might need more technology support, or link to website/Google classroom for more control over specific features to allow choice boards. 
layout of classroom
'decorations' posters on wall
    incorporate computing concepts like logical statements to reiterate that consequences will be consistently enforced, for example
paper on how traditional CS decorations are potentially alienating to girls

Substitute plans (that I can test at end of May on random stuff days)
Gradeable, single day, standalone activities
    Sources? Code.org intro activities, projectSTEM one day activities!
    So many weeks get split up in weird ways, making sticking to a strict schedule impossible. Trying to do so would set teachers up for failure. Have a bank of resources/lessons/activities to include, and give them for as many days as time allows before moving on to next topic. Modular lesson plan design?
        would remove the pressure of staying on schedule or else falling behind
        can leave a topic, but come back to it later with an easy to plug in lesson
            spiraling enabled by being able to move them around
        can organize using something like posets (partially ordered sets)/prereq chains
    difficult to ensure that a topic gets thoroughly covered if a day is missed
    Difficult to align to standards
    benefits of spaced repetition/spiral 
    how to integrate differentiation in this model?
        Assign extra activities as stretch goals?
        I feel like you can't give different assignments from the start
    course content is not really ever completely cumulative
        Programming fundamentals could even be presented as tiny, standalone units. Depending on the amount of other content covered, they can be integrated into multiple larger activities  
            Revisit same content with different tools/approaches?
