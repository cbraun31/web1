TODO:
Standards alignment of unit planning tables
lesson plan formatter tool
quick formative/behavior notebook/stat tracker/table/etc. tool
    sync between teachers? logins?
programming exercise randomizer
Unit planning plug and play modules tool
networking idle game style
    Max flow, add connections and upgrade media
    cost per material
    Also add multiplayer, not idle, 4 coop vs 1 hostile 
layout of classroom thoughts and diagrams
    considerations in computer labs
    seeing screens
    network and power
    group work availability
    cabling such that students don't trip

blookets
html block coding editors?
drag and drop computer assembly demo?
activity where students act as different parts of the computer
pizza store as parallelization example
MINECRAFT WHERE YOU GATE RESOURCES/TOOLS BEHIND CHESTS WITH QUESTIONS/CHALLENGES
web design examples of exact same content with different styling
    A and B Attorneys at Law with regular styling, wedding website style, ecommerce style, game splash screen style
slides bank for basic concepts/definitions



poster activity idea for computer parts 
    let kids select even size groups
    each group chooses one component
    create pieces of paper sized posters for their component each
        Large name of component and abbreviation
        small picture
    Tell groups to find people with other parts to build a computer!
    can display student work on walls that way


2. using different exercises in CodeHS
    scaffolding in CodeHS? Choice boards in codeHS? Might need more technology support, or link to website/Google classroom for more control over specific features to allow choice boards. 
'decorations' posters on wall
    incorporate computing concepts like logical statements to reiterate that consequences will be consistently enforced, for example
paper on how traditional CS decorations are potentially alienating to girls

Substitute plans (that I can test at end of May on random stuff days)
Gradeable, single day, standalone activities
    Sources? Code.org intro activities, projectSTEM one day activities!
    So many weeks get split up in weird ways, making sticking to a strict schedule impossible. Trying to do so would set teachers up for failure. Have a bank of resources/lessons/activities to include, and give them for as many days as time allows before moving on to next topic. Modular lesson plan design?
        would remove the pressure of staying on schedule or else falling behind
        can leave a topic, but come back to it later with an easy to plug in lesson
            spiraling enabled by being able to move them around
        can organize using something like posets (partially ordered sets)/prereq chains
    difficult to ensure that a topic gets thoroughly covered if a day is missed
    Difficult to align to standards
    benefits of spaced repetition/spiral 
    how to integrate differentiation in this model?
        Assign extra activities as stretch goals?
        I feel like you can't give different assignments from the start
    course content is not really ever completely cumulative
        Programming fundamentals could even be presented as tiny, standalone units. Depending on the amount of other content covered, they can be integrated into multiple larger activities  
            Revisit same content with different tools/approaches?
