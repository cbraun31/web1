                                around helping during this time. Specific learning goals of each group's maze
                                problem based on choice:</p>

                                    (Only so many index cards). Give students a card that they can use to repeat a
                                    set of commands<br></li>
                                <li>Variables: have the ability to have input, and read the input as the robot goes
                                    along. Tell students that they don't know what maze will be used, but can see it
                                    as their robot goes through it and can send it information. Give them a card
                                    with a hole in it, and they can use multiple values to fill it in as it
                                    runs<br></li>
                                <li>Conditionals: Give students ability to read a value from environment, and use
                                    that to make a decision. Program should be able to solve 2 mazes with NO PROGRAM
                                    CHANGES! Give students an "if" card and a condition card<br></li>
                                <li>Functions: Enforce a lines of code limit and require that the maze have lots of
                                    right turns and repeating patterns arranged in different ways. Students should
                                    be shown how to make a function to make a right turn. allow students to tape
                                    cards together, give them a name, and make them a single card</li>
