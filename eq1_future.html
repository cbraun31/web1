        Future of Computer Science Education

        The predicament is clear; computer technology is a fundamental part of modern life, and it becomes more embedded
        into society by the day. If we hope to prepare children to thrive in this increasingly computerized world, our
        schools and governments must allocate the resources necessary to support this massive new demand on our
        education system.

        The aforementioned challenges will likely continue into the future, but there are many different approaches to
        mitigate the difficulty they present. These solutions require alignment in goals between students, teachers,
        school administrators, legislators, and community members. Here are actions that each party can do to improve
        the situation:

        Students
        Sign up for available computer science courses
        Request more computer science course offerings
        Request school and community support for computing related extracurricular activities such as robotics (FRC,
        FLL, Vex), programming clubs (Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code), and hackathons.
        Explore the intersection of your other interests and computing. Sports, science, music, politics, and
        literature all have connections to computing.
        Teachers
        For teachers of other disciplines:
        Learn about how computing affects your subject. There are connections everywhere!
        Be mindful of your attitude toward technology in the classroom; students lose respect for computer science if
        they hear other teachers make dismissive comments like "I'm no good with computers" or "This device never
        works."
        Prefer fostering a problem-solving mindset in these situations. People are human, and you'll never know
        everything. Take these frustrating moments as an opportunity to model appropriate and effective responses to
        technological setbacks!
        Collaborate with your CS teachers! Have you spoken with them? Have you asked what connections there are
        between your subject and computer science?
        For CS teachers:
        Strive for content mastery. Most K-12 CS teachers don't have a computer science degree, and many don't even
        have a degree in a related field. Be honest in assessing your gaps in knowledge, and be proactive in filling
        them.
        Demand professional development opportunities that allow you to feel confident and prepared to teach the
        subject
        Integrate other subjects! The introduction of computer technologies into nearly every aspect of modern life is
        an excellent opportunity to integrate student experiences in the presentation of content knowledge; this kind of
        linking to student experience is supported by research to be especially effective in reaching students,
        especially younger students.
        Learn about CS standards for your district, state, and country. While there is not total agreement on
        standards in the US, there are consistent themes that are emphasized in nearly all standards that have been
        published. Review them and determine what exactly the standards are requiring your students to know and to be
        able to do
        Admins
        Support teachers who want to add CS into their skillset!
        share information of professional development opportunities
        advocate for more if sufficient ones don't exist
        facilitate planning between CS and teachers from other disciplines
        Facilitate coordination between your CS teachers and CS teachers from other schools/districts
        Legislators
        Support initiatives that reduce the financial delta between industry and education for CS graduates
        Requirements for including computer science in schools are great, but only if there is investment proportional
        to the size of the change that schools are being asked to make
        Parents/Community Members
        Request more computer science course offerings
        Request school and community support for computing related extracurricular activities such as robotics (FRC,
        FLL, Vex), programming clubs (Girls Who Code, Black Girls Code), and hackathons.
        Support students in finding applications of the ideas of computer science into their daily lives, even if they
        don't like the subject on its own.
        Fundraise for resources necessary to give students opportunities to grow their skills; cloud computing
        subscriptions, hardware resources, etc.
