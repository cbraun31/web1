        <h1>What is a CS Teacher?</h1>
        <p>Our county recently provided all CS teachers with 16 raspberry pi computers. These devices are effective
            tools for computing education for a few reasons; they are tiny, inexpensive, and can easily interface with a
            huge array of standard electronic components. Unfortunately, getting started with projects for raspberry pi
            can be overwhelming for students and teachers alike. Despite my depth of domain expertise, I had been
            hesitant to try to build something with my pis, despite the amount of research that suggests that physical
            computing is an effective instructional strategy.</p>
        <p>Our county lead found a training opportunity at Kennesaw State University that I was able to attend. During
            the workshop, we were guided through the parts of raspberry pi that I had been dreading- setup and getting
            the first circuit working. It was incredibly valuable to experience it from the student perspective. The
            progression of activities, structure of the lessons, and technical knowledge are all things that I will
            integrate into my own classroom.</p>
        <p>The examples at the workshop started with the ‘hello world’ equivalent of hardware; blinking an LED light.
            This simple activity gave students a sanity check that their environment and hardware was configured
            correctly, demonstrated simple hardware and software techniques, and gave students the satisfaction of being
            able to see the result of their work. </p>
        <p>I left the workshop with tons of project ideas; not just for in class activities, but also for larger scale
            demonstrations of concepts in networks, interactive design, and programming logic. I have already designed
            and implemented a networking demonstration including raspberry pis configured as different networking
            devices to show routing, web protocols, and more! I volunteered to share what I’ve learned at the county’s
            computer science summer institute training. I am looking forward to meeting with the other disciplinary
            teachers to learn some of their organization, lesson planning, and classroom management techniques, as I
            know that is where I struggle the most.</p>
        <p>I believe that a teacher in any discipline should be a lifelong learner, but given the pace at which CS
            evolves, it is even more critical in this field. As a CS teacher, it is important to both keep up with new
            technology and model the curiousity and willingness to learn that we hope to see in our students.</p>
