        <h1> Current state of computer science education in the US</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> As of 2022, every state has adopted computer science requirements for K-12 education. However, only 71% of Georgia schools offered a CS course in 2023. This actually puts Georgia ahead of many states; only 57.5% of schools in the US offer foundational Computer Science (). How is it possible to have this large of a gap when all schools are now required by law to provide these courses? State legislatures have all agreed that the idea of implementing CS programs in K-12 education is a worthwhile goal, but, in practice, many obstacles have been encountered. This page will outline some of the main problems facing K-12 computer science education. </p>

                <h2> General Teacher Shortage </h2> As has been well documented, the US if facing a shortage of teachers across every discipline <button type="button" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="National Center for Education Statistics. (2022). Digest of Education Statistics, 2022. Nces.ed.gov.

                <h2>Lack of CS Expertise in the Workforce</h2>
                <p> The content area knowledge necessary to be an effective computer science educator is not something that most people have ever even been exposed to, even if they are highly educated. The average age of teachers in the US is over 42. Given that the first legislation to require CS courses was passed in 2017, it is extremely unlikely that teachers graduating before that had the opportunity to explore CS in their schooling. This makes CS unique among subjects taught in schools; it can't be assumed that most teachers have ANY exposure to the subject at all, much less any expertise. I have not been able to find studies regarding the percentage of adults/teachers in the US that have taken at least on computer science class. To be an effective computer science teacher, a candidate needs to simultaneously be an expert in multiple areas of computer science and have a desire to pursue teaching instead of any other opportunities that their skills allow. </p>

                <h2> Disproportionately Low Income Compared to Industry </h2>
                <p> Great irony displayed in motivation of implementing computer science in schools. "It can make a lot of money" is a common refrain from proponents of adding CS to the K-12 curriculum. This is true, especially when considering benefits like the increased opportunities for remote work to increase competition for talent and eliminate commuting expenses. However, this idea taken to its logical conclusion is problematic for school districts looking to add qualified computer science teachers to their ranks; if I am qualified enough to be a computer science teacher, then what incentive do I have to pursue teaching over industry? Teaching salaries are extremely low when compared to what a computer science graduate could make with an entry level position in software engineering, cybersecurity, or UI/UX design. This increased delta makes it challenging for schools to attract talent that would otherwise be interested in education. I personally took a pay cut of ~60% when I left industry to enter the classroom. </p>

                <h2> Isolation of CS teachers and lack of collaboration with core area teachers </h2>
                <p> Computer Science is often lumped in with Connections or elective courses. This offers increased flexibility for educators to implement the curriculum as they see fit, but it eliminates the possibility of coordinating with teachers from other content areas. While it may seem necessary to only conference with math educators, the computer science standards (rightfully, in my opinion) include thinking critically about the role of technology in students' lives and society as a whole. The opportunity to collaborate with educators of core subjects is necessary to provide an integrated and coherent experience for students. Computer science teachers are often alone in their buildings in terms of content matter experts; high schools may have 2 or 3 teachers who specialize in different aspects of computer science (often graphics/animation, web design, and networking). This lack of built in community makes it difficult for CS teachers to share information, get feedback, and learn from others. </p>

        <p>A fantastic source of data is Code.org's collection of resources found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gySkItxiJn_vwb8HIIKNXqen184mRtzDX12cux0ZgZk/pub">here</a>, state of CS Education report <a href="https://advocacy.code.org/2023_state_of_cs.pdf">here</a>, and policy recommendations found <a href="https://advocacy.code.org/2023_making_cs_foundational.pdf">here</a>. I haven't had time to go through all of the original sources myself yet, but it appears that these are too good to not include!</p>
