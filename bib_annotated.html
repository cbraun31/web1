Pearson. <p>This book offers a perspective on ethical issues in computing from 2003. While the examples may be lost on the current generation of students (Napster anyone?), it is eerie that the problems presented here are ones that we are still facing 20 years later. Even in the early 2000's, Baase forecasts the effect that technology would have on education. "Both the technological advances brought about by computers and the extraordinary pace of development can have dramatic impacts on people's lives... Traditional forms of education face competition from software and electronic classrooms." (Baase, 2009, p7).</p>
                <p>With the newly available generative AI tools, a familiar concern echoes- do the conveniences of computing resources lead to a decline of human ability? "People are often willing to let computers do their thinking for them. Abdication of responsibility to exercise judgement, and sometimes, a reasonable amount of skepticism, has serious consequences." (Baase, 2003, p376). I have already seen these consequences in my short time in the classroom. One assignment involved students facing an object East. Unsure of which way that was, they turned to Google for help, only for the first image to have east and west reversed! There is a balance that needs to be struck between taking advantage of the wealth of knowledge available to us and verifying that what we find online is corroborated elsewhere.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Zone of Proximal Development: The idea that for any learner learning any skill, there exists a task at a threshold of difficulty which challenges them, but can be accomplished. However, Vygotsky also emphasized the importance of allowing some supports to be used in assessment, which he called- </li>
                    <li> Scaffolding: Supports that are designed to remove frustrating roadblocks, focus on the important information, probe into their thinking process, etc. while still allowing the learner to feel the achievement of completing the task. One scaffold that Vygotsky specifically encouraged was coined- </li>
                    <li> Most Knowledgeable Other: A peer learner that has best grasped the learning objective. In helping their peers learn the material they've just mastered, Vygotsky suggests that both parties are enhanced. The MKO reinforces their content knowledge, and potentially sees the problem from a new perspective or reveals previously unknown misconceptions. The peer learner gets to learn from a person with the same perspective that they have: someone who has just learned the content. This helps ease anxiety, allows students to be more open with questions than they may be with the teacher, and encourages positive interactions between students to foster a pleasant learning environment. </li>
                </ul> Aside from being generally well regarded by the research community, these ideas also mirror content from computer science. For example, “Break[ing] the given task into smaller sub-tasks” (p46) is also fundamental for students to learn as they approach computing problems. This affords an excellent opportunity to allow students to work with a Most Knowledgeable Other to break the problem down together. The students simultaneously benefit from reinforcing content knowledge and building experience in the process of breaking down problems.</p>

Pearson. <p>Chapter 8 and 9 of the book outline instruction techniques in two broad categories: student-centered (Ch 8) and teacher-centered (Ch 9). The authors suggest that student-centered modes of instruction be preferred. "Strategies within [the access mode] are more student centered, hands-on, and concrete; students interact with one another and are actually (or are closer to) doing what they are learning to do - that is, the learning is likely more authentic." (p.257) Techniques in the access mode include group work, educational games, and project based learning. </p>
                <p>While the authors recommend that most time be spent in the access mode, they note that some tasks call for teacher-centered strategies. Models such as the gradual release of responsibility, which also seek to maximize time spent in the access mode, emphasize the importance of teacher talk as a way to introduce new topics, link activities together, and ensure that all students are primed to receive the learning targets. Carjuzza and Kellough mention that so called 'teacher talk' doesn't need to be entirely one sided; "Students should be encouraged to ask questions" (p.295) This serves to foster a cooperative learning environment, expose student misconceptions, and build skills in finding information if the teacher does not know the answer.</p>

Norton &amp; Company. <p>While the purpose of this book is to share humorous and interesting anecdotes, making Richard Feynman the subject leads to many unintentional insights. Many of his thoughts can be backed up by learning theorists. For example, take this quote on needing a purpose to learn something; "I mean, if I were doing any mathematical thing at all, I would find some practical example for which it would be useful." (p30). Framing material in the context of what the learner will be able to accomplish with this skill is a common theme in both constructivist and sociocultural theories of learning. On learning by doing difficult work, Feynman stumbles into something that echoes Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development; "That was a very good way to get educated, working on the senior problems and learning how to pronounce things." (p41). Sharing these anecdotes with my students helps to bring some real life examples of what a problem solving mind looks like, and encourage them that problem solving skills don't have to be mutually exclusive with their other interests!</p>

            <li class="apa-ref">Fisher, D., &amp; Frey, N. (2021). Better learning through structured teaching. Alexandria, Va, Usa Ascd. <p> This book covers the “Gradual Release of Responsibility” model of instruction. The idea is that simply lecturing is ineffective and not engaging, but students will be lost without some sort of guidance at the start. The approach offers 4 stages: I do, we do together, you do together, you do alone. At first, students benefit most from getting clarity on what exactly it is that they should focus on learning. This is where the teacher should show examples, presentations, or demonstrations. Once the students have established the context for the learning, it is a good time to incorporate quiz games, interactive examples, and other formative assessment strategies. When students demonstrate a basic proficiency with the ideas, it is time to present students with new problems and have them work together to solve them using the strategies they learned. This step is an important bridge; often, we skip straight from guided examples to individual work. The recommendation to allow students to work together stems from Vygotsky, who suggests that a more authentic method of assessment involves giving the student some supports on the task. Finally, when students are comfortable working together to solve problems, new problems can be introduced for the students to solve individually. While group work is a popular and often effective instructional tool, this step ensures that each student is internalizing the new skill and its applications. </p>
                <p> “Focused instruction is typically done with the whole class and usually lasts 15 minutes or less…” (p5). Balancing direct instruction is an area that I struggle with in my classroom. Because I feel confident in my content knowledge, I can lose sight of the student perspective and overlook their misconceptions, making the direct instruction ineffective and frustrating for students. On the other end of the spectrum, because of my experience in 1 on 1 situations and struggles with classroom management, there are many times when I send my students to do a task without first giving them a solid enough foundation to succeed, hoping to correct them individually as they go. One main challenge I have in implementing this in my classroom is design and performing of formative assessments to ensure that my students have learned enough to get started before I hand over the reigns entirely.</p>

Www.georgiastandards.org. https://www.georgiastandards.org/Georgia-Standards/Pages/Computer-Science.aspx<p>The Georgia standards for computer science list the courses approved by the state for each level of student, learning objectives for each course, and expectations of educator competencies of the teachers delivering them. For my position in middle school, there are 3 courses: Foundations of Computer Programming, Intro to Secure Information Systems, and Intro to Interactive Design. The standards are vague in many critical areas, including in the most straightforward of measures- what vocabulary students should be familiar with. The lack of clarity is exacerbated as the level of abstraction is raised, rendering many of the items either unachieveable or completely devoid of meaning. I plan to spend significant effort in addressing these concerns in my future studies in CS education.</p>
                <p>Due to the freedom of not having a standardized assessment at the end of the courses, the generality of the standards can be viewed as an advantage for creative and passionate educators. There is no test to teach to, and many fun and engaging activities can be linked to the concepts presented in the standards. Students can be given more agency in diving deep into topics they care about as opposed to strictly adhering to a curriculum. I use this flexibility most notably with my overachieving students to give them ungraded work that sparks their curiousity. </p>

            <li class="apa-ref">Heacox, D. (2012). Differentiating instruction in the regular classroom: How to reach and teach all learners. Free Spirit Publishing. <p> Chapter 5 addresses methods and considerations for making effective student groups. Heacox is reluctant to offer a single grouping strategy for all cases, saying that "Flexible use of student groups is the heart of differentiated instruction" (p.85) She further notes that having a flexible grouping strategy allows you to tailor the experiences of your students as you see fit. You can group students by type of project, interests, or other factors, but the goal is to create instructional groups that cater to the varying learning needs of all the students. She is in agreement with other theorists when she cautions against having <i>everything</i> be done in groups. Heacox identifies 2 situations in which she suggests using these grouping strategies, which she terms "[E]xit points: (1) When some students haven't yet mastered skills or content and others are ready to move on, or (2) when some students would benefit from an advanced task and others from a more basic activity" (p.85-86) </p>
                <p> Heacox offers further tips on how to use flexible grouping, and things to keep in mind:
                <ol>
                    <li> Divide into groups no bigger than 4 or 5. </li>
                    <li> Don't spend a fixed amount of time with each group. </li>
                    <li> Create more time to spend with some groups by providing other groups with activities that require minimal direction. </li>
                    <li> Create tasks that students can manage themselves once they get started. To enable this, provide them with a checklist of steps to follow. </li>
                    <li> Provide rubrics, examples, or other clear expectations on quality of work </li>
                    <li> Establish clear expectations on noise and movement in the classroom. Find best locations for each group, and detail how materials/questions should be handled. </li>
                    <li> Provide guidance on how students should get assistance from you </li>
                    <li> Convey expectations about individual accountability for time management </li>
                    <li> TELL THEM WHAT TO DO WHEN THEY ARE FINISHED </li>
                    <li> If applicable, allow time at end/beginning of next class for student groups to share, present, or demonstrate work. </li>

Pearson. <p> This book is an overview of philosophical ideas (Realism, Pragmatism, etc.) on teaching as a discipline, and how that shapes your perspective on curriculum, instruction, and assessment. Among the philosophies presented, I resonated most with Realism and Pragmatism. In discussing Realism, the authors echo the recommendation of learning theorists that knowledge should be put in a context that is familiar and interesting to the learner. "Teachers must have specific knowledge about a subject so that they can order it in such a way as to teach it rationally. They must also have a broad background to show relationships that exist among all fields of knowledge." (p.92) The authors describe the facets of pragmatism, including "using ideas as instruments for problem solving." (p.94) This is a beautiful way to phrase that idea, and it is one that I often use in my own classroom by describing specific programming operations as tools, and asking students to consider if they have tools in their toolbox to solve their problem. </p>
                <p> Technology is a fixture of modern society. We have an obligation to teach students how to navigate this world, and to do that, they will need a basic understanding of the foundational technologies that power their daily lives. "No matter what you think about technology, it is here to stay...By constantly asking broader questions and encouraging students to do the same, schools can provide a forum for controlling and encouraging the development of technology."

            <p>This is the legislation that enacted the requirements for computer science education in the state of Georgia.

This change further contributes to the massive gap in the number of job openings vs the number of qualified CS teachers. To help address this gap at the local level, I hope to start getting involved with local PD efforts, starting with the CS Summer Institute 2 day training in June this year. I am excited to be in a district that encourages their teachers to share their knowledge and provides frequent and meaningful opportunities to do so.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, only 57% of schools in the US offer computer science right now due to lack of available qualified personnel. In addition to the requirements, legislators should consider adding additional resources to the recruitment, training, and retention of qualified CS educators.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Presenting methods on problem solving strategies including decomposition, working through various levels of abstraction, and identifying common misconceptions and mistakes. </li>

ACM Transactions on Computing Education, 20(1), 1-37. https://doi.org/10.1145/3372143<p> This paper offers a framework for teaching the concept of abstraction to middle school students. Abstraction refers to the level of implementation details you consider in a problem. For example, in thinking about how to get from home to school, you can think of it at a 'high' level (I will walk to the bus stop, then take the bus) or a 'low' level (First, I stand up from my bed. Then I walk 8 steps forward, then I turn 90 degrees left...). Being able to focus on one level at a time is a critical skill in computer science so that we make sure we spend our time solving the right problem and focusing on the most important elements first before getting into specific details.</p>
                <p> The framework proposed was simple: consider 4 levels of abstraction (machine, program, object, problem), and train teachers to be deliberate in using those terms when discussing programming tasks, and pay special attention to the object layer (the one that would focus on algorithms). The result was a marked increase in student outcomes. </p>
                <p> Teach a concept early and often! This makes it feel less punishing to 'move on' from a concept that some learners are still struggling with. They will see the content in another context later, and if there are supporting assessment procedures and policies in place, then the student will have the opportunity to revisit the ideas after they have thought about them more. As a fundamental idea in CS, CS abstraction fits into Bruner's framework of spiral teaching. According to the principles of spiral teaching, to achieve meaningful learning of abstraction, this idea should be taught as early as possible, and in an age-appropriate manner...Then it should be revisited at later levels of education up to the undergraduate levels, and in each case in an age-appropriate manner. </p>
                <p> One challenge of applying spiral models in CS classrooms is that you have NO idea how much CS your class has seen- a problem that persists all the way from elementary school through undergraduate study. [I]n the case of students who are first introduced to CS earlier, for example, in elementary school, the basis of the spiral will also be set earlier and the middle-school level will become an intermediate phase. Similarly, when K-12 CS education is not available, the basis of the spiral will be set at an undergraduate introductory CS course level. </p>
                <p> Be careful with word choice in describing concepts that are overloaded with specific programming language level operations. "Use linguistic aids to distinguish between levels in order to assist students in understanding at which level the session is currently taking place... [W]e already have specialized words and unique terms derived from the programming language." </p>
                <p>The recommendations provided in this paper are so clear and actionable that I can start incorporating the approach in my classroom immediately! The emphasis on spiral curriculum in this study is encouraging, as I was frustrated by the curriculum/standards until thinking about implementing a spiral approach. For example, an exercise on maze solving could be presented on one day to introduce the concepts of instruction ordering, but could have extension exercises on functions that would serve both as differentiation if students quickly grasp the concept on the first day and spiraling/reteaching when the concept of the extension comes up. </p>
