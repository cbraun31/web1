            <li>This book offers a perspective on ethical issues in computing from 2003. While the examples may be lost
                on the current generation of students (Napster anyone?), it is eerie that the problems presented here
                are ones that we are still facing 20 years later. Even in the early 2000’s, Baase forecasts the effect
                that technology would have on education. "Both the technological advances brought about by computers and
                the extraordinary pace of development can have dramatic impacts on people's lives... Traditional forms
                of education face competition from software and electronic classrooms." (Baase, 2009, p7).&nbsp;</li>
            <li>With the newly available generative AI tools, a familiar concern echoes- do the conveniences of
                computing resources lead to a decline of human ability? "People are often willing to let computers do
                their thinking for them. Abdication of responsibility to exercise judgement, and sometimes, a reasonable
                amount of skepticism, has serious consequences." (Baase, 2003, p376). I have already seen these
                consequences in my short time in the classroom. One assignment involved students facing an object East.
                Unsure of which way that was, they turned to Google for help, only for the first image to have east and
                west reversed! There is a balance that needs to be struck between taking advantage of the wealth of
                knowledge available to us and verifying that what we find online is corroborated elsewhere.</li>

            <li>In Chapter 16, the authors review Cognitivism from the perspective of Vygotsky’s work. The principles,
                aside from being generally well regarded by the research community, also mirror content from computer
                science. For example. “Break the given task into smaller sub-tasks” (p46) is also fundamental for
                students to learn as they approach computing problems. This affords an excellent opportunity to allow
                students to work with a Most Knowledgeable Other to break the problem down together. The students
                simultaneously benefit from reinforcing content knowledge and building experience in the process of
                breaking down problems.</li>

            <li>While the purpose of this book is to share humorous and interesting anecdotes, making Richard Feynman
                the subject leads to many unintentional insights. Many of his thoughts can be backed up by learning
                theorists. For example, take this quote on his needing motivation to learn a skill "I mean, if I were
                doing any mathematical thing at all, I would find some practical example for which it would be useful."
                (p30). Framing material in the context of what the learner will be able to accomplish with this skill is
                a popular principle. On learning by doing difficult work, Feynman stumbles into something that echoes
                Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development; "That was a very good way to get educated, working on the
                senior problems and learning how to pronounce things." (p41).</li>

                Ascd.</li>
            <li>This book covers the “Gradual Release of Responsibility” model of instruction. The idea is that simply
                lecturing is ineffective and not engaging, but students will be lost without some sort of guidance at
                the start. The approach offers 4 stages: I do, we do, you do together, you do alone.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>“Focused instruction is typically done with the whole class and usually lasts 15 minutes or less…” (p5).
                This is an area that I struggle with in my classroom. Because I feel confident in my ability to tutor 1
                on 1 and struggle with classroom management, there are many times when I send my students to do a task
                without first giving them a solid enough foundation to succeed. One main challenge I have in
                implementing this in my classroom is design and performing of formative assessments to ensure that my
                students have learned enough to get started.</li>
