                <ul>
                    <li>Behaviourism: Behaviour can be predicted, measured, and controlled. Learning is a matter of stimulus and response</li>
                    <li>Constructivism: Learning isn't something to be delivered to students by them passively listening to a teacher dispensing knowledge. Instead, meaningful knowledge and understanding are actively constructed by learners... which builds on what they already know causing them to change and adapt and invent ideas.</li>
                    <li>Humanism: Education should focus on the individual learner, their needs, and their personal and emotional growth.</li>
