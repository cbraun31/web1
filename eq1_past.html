        <h1>Past, present and future of CS as an educational discipline</h1>

        <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>
            Current state of computer science education in the US:
            As of 2022, every state has adopted computer science requirements for K-12 education. However, only 71% of
            Georgia schools offered a CS course in 2023. This actually puts Georgia ahead of many states; only 57.5% of
            schools in the US offer foundational Computer Science. How is it possible to have this large of a gap when
            schools are required by law to provide these courses?

            State legislatures have all agreed that the idea of implementing CS programs in K-12 education is a
            worthwhile goal, but, in practice, many obstacles have been encountered. This site will outline some of the
            main problems facing K-12 computer science education:
            1. General Teacher Shortage
            a. As has been well documented, the US if facing a shortage of teachers across every discipline.
            b. However, this shortage is more salient in math and science compared to social studies and ELA.
            c. This effect intensifies when we increase the specificity of skills needed to be a CS teacher.
            2. Lack of Qualified Candidates
            a. The content area knowledge necessary to be an effective computer science educator is not something that
            most people have ever even been exposed to, even if they are highly educated. To be an effective computer
            science teacher, a candidate needs to simultaneously
            i. be an expert in multiple areas of computer science
            ii. have a desire to pursue teaching instead of any other opportunities that their skills allow
            3. Disproportionately low income compared to industry
            a. Great irony displayed in motivation of implementing computer science in schools; it can make a lot of
            money is a common refrain from proponents of adding CS to the K-12 curriculum. This is true, especially when
            considering benefits like the increased opportunities for remote work to increase competition for talent and
            eliminate commuting expenses. However, this idea taken to its logical conclusion is problematic for school
            districts looking to add qualified computer science teachers to their ranks. If I am qualified enough to be
            a computer science teacher, then what incentive do I have to pursue teaching over industry?
            b. Teaching salaries are extremely low when compared to what a computer science graduate could make with an
            entry level position in software engineering, cybersecurity, or UI/UX design. This increased delta makes it
            challenging for schools to attract talent that would otherwise be interested in education. I personally took
            a pay cut of ~60% when I left industry to enter the classroom.
            4. Isolation of CS teachers and lack of collaboration with 'academic' teachers
            a. Computer Science is often lumped in with Connections or elective courses. This offers increased
            flexibility for educators to implement the curriculum as they see fit, but it eliminates the possibility of
            coordinating with teachers from other content areas. While it may seem necessary to only conference with
            math educators, the computer science standards (rightfully, in my opinion) include thinking critically about
            the role of technology in students' lives and society as a whole. The opportunity to collaborate with
            educators of core subjects is necessary to provide an integrated and coherent experience for students.
            b. Computer science teachers are often alone in their buildings in terms of content matter experts; high
            schools may have 2 or 3 teachers who specialize in different aspects of computer science (often
            graphics/animation, web design, and networking). This lack of built in community makes it difficult for CS
            teachers to share information, get feedback, and learn from others.
